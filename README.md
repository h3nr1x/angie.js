angie.js
=========

"ANother GraphIcs Engine for Javascript" or "angie.js" is a graphics library aimed for 3d/2d software rendering graphics using pixel buffers with the canvas element

Why do a Software Renderer when today's WebGL support in browsers is pretty good? 

 * The project is for review/learning purposes of the 3d graphics pipeline. An exercise,
   the code written here does to the mind what a day of jogging in a public park does to the body, it lets you find yourself and the true meaning of things, besides being
   healthy.   
 * To create simple demos that don't require too much html5 support from the browser (except for the canvas element)
